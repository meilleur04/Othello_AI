# Othello_AI
This project implements the game of Othello (also known as Reversi) with AI agents using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach. Othello is a classic board game that involves strategy and critical thinking.
# Description
This project provides an implementation of the Othello board game with AI agents. It allows users to play against a computer opponent or watch AI agents play against each other. The AI agents are trained using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, which learns to make optimal moves based on the current game state.
